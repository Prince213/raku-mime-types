MIME::Types
------------
A Perl 6 library that reads the mime.types file as used by
many Linux distributions, and web servers, and returns an object
that can be queried by either type or extension.

Example:

  use MIME::Types;
  my $mime = MIME::Types.new("/etc/mime.types");
  my $type = $mime.type('txt'); ## Returns: 'text/plain';
  my @known_extensions = $mime.extensions('application/vnd.ms-excel');
  ## Returns: [ 'xls', 'xlb', 'xlt' ]

An example mime.types is included in the doc/ directory, and is used by
the tests in t/.
